# Firebase x react-awesome-resume

This project is basically a fork of [user]('https://github.com/deltaskelta/')'s [react-awesome-resume]('https://github.com/deltaskelta/react-awesome-resume') using Firebase to store your info instead of a static file you'd need to deploy for each update. Yet, there were a few changes made to the source code:

- First one (easy to notice), this project is a full client, it was build using [create-react-app]('https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app')
- Home page contains some of the other sections, it is opinionated and maybe less clean but who likes to click ?
